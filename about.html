        Hello, I'm Sara and I'm a <b>Higher Technician In Design And Edition Of Online And <br>Printed Publications</b>.
        <br>
        As a designer, I find pleasure on experimenting, trying and discovering new challenges everyday. I enjoy constantly adapting and changing, as time and life does, so that I can surprise myself to find new things.
       <br>
        To me, everything has always been about being creative and playful. I have been in touch with art since little, and still try to be active on my art studies and work.
        I have always kept myself busy with various projects and courses, and I plan on keeping it that way. <br><br>You can never stop learning about design, that's what I most like about it.
